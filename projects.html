            <p >
              This one is a Producers Responsibility Organisation that helps you
              yield maximum benefits from your trash, and specialises in recycling
              all kinds of packaging waste. The pan-India service also makes

            <p>Founded in 2015, this organisation helps food chains and restaurants manage their waste at the source. They collect reject waste from the premises, provide data-driven feedback modules on proper segregation to staff, and ensure that the highest possible amount of waste is reused or recycled. Through their mobile app, which also has a tracking monitor, customers can understand the quality and quantity of their waste on user-friendly graphs. Till date, Good Food has diverted over 9,000 tonnes of waste from landfills. </p>

            <p>Green Plastic connects waste-pickers to global markets, and helps brands switch to high-quality recycled plastic for packaging their goods. Their mobile app provides urban waste-pickers with access to fair market prices, and they are also slowly foraying into coastal communities to address the root cause of ocean plastic. </p>
